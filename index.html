        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. An example of inline CSS is using the “style” attribute to change the color of a singe “h1” heading. </li>

          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>

          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTMLs head.</li>

          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>

          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. The declaration “color: blue;” includes the CSS property “color” and the value for that property, “blue.”</li>

          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>

          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

          <li>A class attribute adds styles to certain elements, but not all elements. They allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

          <li>A “margin” property acts much like a margin in a word processing document, it indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. When it is set to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>

          <li>The “padding” property is often confused with “margin,” but it is not the same thing. It adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger.</li>
