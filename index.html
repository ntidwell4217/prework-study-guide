        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use <em>inline CSS</em>. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. An example of inline CSS is using the “style” attribute to change the color of a single “h1” heading: </li>
          <br>
          <center> <font color="red">&lt;h1</font> <font color="green">style=</font><font color="blue">"color:white;"</font><font color="red">&gt;</font>Prework Study Guide <font color="purple">&lt;/h1&gt;</font></center>
          <br>

          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; element. This <em>internal style sheet</em> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          
          <br>
          <li>An <em>external CSS style sheet</em> is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTMLs &lt;head&gt;.</li>
          <br>
          <li><em>Separation of concerns</em> is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <br>
          <li><em>Declarations</em> contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. The declaration “color: blue;” includes the CSS property “color” and the value for that property, “blue.”</li>
          <br>
          <li>A &lt;link&gt; element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The &lt;rel&gt; attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A <em>class</em> attribute adds styles to certain elements, but not all elements. They allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A “margin” property acts much like a margin in a word processing document, it indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. When it is set to 0, we are indicating that we want <b>NO</b> extra space around the element.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The “padding” property is often confused with “margin,” but it is not the same thing. It adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <br>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><em>JavaScript</em> is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with website. With JS you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A <em>variable</em> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. To declare a variable, we use the “var” keyword. After the “var” keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code. Finally, we use an <em>assignment operator</em> “=” to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <br>
          <center> <font color = blue>var</font> <font color = black>topics = <font color = green> "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript"</font><font color = black>;</font></center>
          <br>
          <li>The “topics” variable contains a string that includes all the topics that we are studying in this module. All strings are surrounded by quotation marks, and each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon. To access the string “HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript” we can simply refer to the variable’s name, “topics.”</li>
          <br>
          <li>Use the “console.log” method to output a message to the web console by adding an <em>argument</em>. In this case, “console.log” will output the value of “topics” to the web console because we’ve added it as an argument inside the parenthesis.</li>
          <br>
          <li><em>Control flow</em> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. We can use <em>conditional statements</em> and loops to control the order in which the code is executed, or if it is even executed at all. </li>
          <br>
          <li>The conditional statement, “if,” means the code will only execute it the statement meets a condition or is true. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between the curly brackets. If the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
          <br>
          <li>An <em>array</em> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A “for” loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <br>
          <li><em>Commenting out</em> code makes it inactive without deleting it, to do this in JS, put “/*” before and “*/” after the block of code.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A <em>function</em> is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function’s name is followed by parentheses, “().”</li>
